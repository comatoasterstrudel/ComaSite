                <p>This room is mostly me talking about stuff going on in my life,</p>
                <p>or things I'm interested in! There will also be updates with projects I'm working on!</p>
                <p>Expect the writing to be messy, and stuff to be unprofessional.</p>
                <p>I mostly want to write down my thoughts and not focus on being formal.</p>
                <p>I would like blogs to be every week or so, but it might be more or less depending on what I want to do..</p>
